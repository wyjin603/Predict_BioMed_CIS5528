# Python ML Project Guidelines
# ============================
# Language & Version:
- Use Python 3.10+ exclusively.

# Library Stack:
- Import and use the following libraries:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - PyTorch
  - matplotlib or Plotly for visualization
  - logging (with a Rich handler, if available)
  - pytest for testing
  - others to be added as needed

# Code Style & Documentation:
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines for code style.
- Include comprehensive type annotations in every function, method, and class.
- Write Google-style docstrings for all functions, methods, and classes.
- Use explicit, descriptive variable names.
- Use early returns for clarity and to simplify logic.

# Project Structure & Modularity:
- Organize code into clear modules:
  - data_processing.py (data loading and preprocessing)
  - model.py (model definition and architecture)
  - train.py (training routines and hyperparameter tuning)
  - evaluate.py (model evaluation and metrics computation)
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility.

# Machine Learning Best Practices:
- For data processing, ensure you:
  - Validate and clean data using pandas.
  - Split data properly into training, validation, and test sets.
- For model development:
  - Use scikit-learn for classical ML algorithms.
  - Use PyTorch for deep learning models, with proper GPU utilization.
  - Include error handling and logging for model training.
- Write unit tests for critical functions using pytest.

# Performance & Experimentation:
- Optimize performance by:
  - Using vectorized operations with numpy and pandas.
  - Profiling code to identify bottlenecks.
- Ensure reproducibility by:
  - Setting random seeds.
  - Logging experiment configurations (consider using mlflow or similar).

# Additional Instructions:
- When generating code, always:
  - Include clear inline comments explaining key steps.
  - Use modular design so that code is reusable and maintainable.
  - Provide usage examples where applicable.
